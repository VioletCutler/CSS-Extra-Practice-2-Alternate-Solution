Exercise One: Create functioning layouts in CSS grid and CSS flex

For this exercise your task is to replicate the provided image of a basic calculator using grid
 
Here is the checklist for this section:
1.	The layout should match the provided image
2.	The color scheme may be altered but some color palette should be used
3.	Buttons do not have to be circles but at the very least must be rounded

Exercise Two: Demonstrate the use of various kinds of CSS units (px, em, rem, vw, vh, %, etc)

Here is the checklist for this section:
Create a file to hold the css instructions and link it to the exercise2 html file
1.	Outer shell set:
        •	Width: 50% view width
        •	Background color: blue
        •	Border: 1% view height
        •	Border style: dashed
        •	Border radius: 10px
        •	Center the div on the page


2.	Middle shell set:
        •	Border: 1rem
        •	Border style: solid
        •	Border color: red
        •	Border radius: 5px

3.	Inner Shell set:
        •	Background color: green
        •	Color: gold
        •	Padding: 1px


Exercise Three: Demonstrate the use of more advanced CSS selectors: media queries, nth selectors, !important, hierarchical selectors

Use a style element in the head of the html file to style the file.
Here is the checklist for this section:

Modify the exercise3 html file so that when the screen is 500px or greater:
    •	The background is blue
    •	The text large screen is highlighted

When the screen width is less than 500px:
    •	The background is green
    •	The text small screen is highlighted

The always on should be highlighted in red regardless of screen size
All text should be centered
